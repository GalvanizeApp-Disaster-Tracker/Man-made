"# Man-made" 

Goals:
- user able to input a location (either by typing in or clicking on a map) to get the air quality index for that area, and listing any precautions to follow
^^ That data would be pulled from an API and stored in a database
- geographic areas in a drop-down list, can select to view a specific man-made disaster (pipeline spills, industrial fires, introduction of invasive species, etc)
